    <header>Introduction to HTML</header>
    <article>
      <p>At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these, and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Getting_started_with_HTML">
    <header>Getting started with HTML</header>
    <article>
      <p>Covers the absolute basics of HTML, to get you started — we define elements, attributes, and other important terms, and show where they fit in the language. We also show how a typical HTML page is structured and how an HTML element is structured, and explain other important basic language features. Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you interested!</p>

    <header>What’s in the head? Metadata in HTML</header>
    <article>
      <p>The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded. It contains information such as the page &lttitle&gt, links to CSS (if you want to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and metadata (data about the HTML, such as who wrote it, and important keywords that describe the document).</p>

    <header>HTML text fundamentals</header>
    <article>
      <p>One of HTML's main jobs is to give text meaning (also known as semantics), so that the browser knows how to display it correctly. This article looks at how to use HTML to break up a block of text into a structure of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words, create lists, and more.<p>

    <header>Creating hyperlinks</header>

      <p>Hyperlinks are really important — they are what makes the web a web. This article shows the syntax required to make a link, and discusses best practices for links.</p>

    <header>Advanced text formatting</header>
    <article>
      <p>There are many other elements in HTML for formatting text that we didn't get to in the HTML text fundamentals article. The elements in here are less well-known, but still useful to know about. In this article you'll learn about marking up quotations, description lists, computer code and other related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and more.</p>

    <header>Document and website structure</header>
    <article>
      <p>As well as defining individual parts of your page (such as "a paragraph" or "an image"), HTML is also used to define areas of your website (such as "the header," "the navigation menu," or "the main content column.") This article looks into how to plan a basic website structure and how to write the HTML to represent this structure.</p>

      <p>Writing HTML is fine, but what if something goes wrong, and you can't work out where the error in the code is? This article will introduce you to some tools that can help.</p>

      <header>Multimedia and embedding</header>
      <article>
        <p>We've looked at a lot of text so far in this course, but the web would be really boring only using text. Let's start looking at how to make the web come alive with more interesting content! This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including the different ways that images can be included, and how to embed video, audio, and even entire webpages.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Images_in_HTML">
    <header>Images in HTML</header>
    <article>
      <p>There are other types of multimedia to consider, but it is logical to start with the humble &ltimg&gt element used to embed a simple image in a webpage. In this article we'll look at how to use it in more depth, including basics, annotating it with captions using &ltfigure&gt, and how it relates to CSS background images.</p>

    <article>
      <p>Next, we'll look at how to use the HTML5 &ltvideo&gt and &ltaudio&gt elements to embed video and audio on our pages, including basics, providing access to different file formats to different browsers, adding captions and subtitles, and how to add fallbacks for older browsers.</p>

    <header>Adding vector graphics to the web</header>
    <article>
      <p>Vector graphics can be very useful in certain situations. Unlike regular formats like PNG/JPG, they don't distort/pixelate when zoomed in — they can remain smooth when scaled. This article introduces you to what vector graphics are and how to include the popular SVG format in web pages.</p>

    <header>Responsive images</header>
    <article>
      <p>With so many different device types now able to browse the web — from mobile phones to desktop computers — an essential concept to master in the modern web world is responsive design. This refers to the creation of webpages that can automatically change their features to suit different screen sizes, resolutions, etc. This will be looked at in much more detail in a CSS module later on, but for now, we'll look at the tools HTML has available to create responsive images, including the &ltpicture&gt element.</p>
